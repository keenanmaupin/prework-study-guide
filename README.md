# prework-study-guide

## Description

- The main motivation of this project was to create a study guide for all of the information gained in the coding bootcamp prework, be able to quickly and efficently find the data, and help coding students decide what to study first.
- I built this project to not only help my self organize useful data of building blocks to coding, but aslo allow current/ future students of code access its helpful knowledge and user friendly design.
- The problem that this project solved was what information, pertaining to coding, should an early student in the coding bootcamp should begin learning first and organization of data inv involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Deployment of a webpage.
- Throughout tthis projects development I learned a great amount of information such as how with in HTML we are creating the base structure of our code, also how CSS allows us to manipulate the visual construction of our web page, Lastly by understanding the binging use of JavaScript we give our webpage logic utalizing multiple pattern base properties such as: [for loops, if statemnts, else if statemnts, and functions].
