        <li>The head element contains Metadata for the web page and inside contains tags</li>
        <li>Title- very important for the SEO search engine optimization</li>
        <li>Style- utalizing CSS for The look of the desired website</li>
        <li>Base- this being the URL</li>
        <li>Link- connects external sources to HTML doc</li>
        <li>Meta- character set, description, keywords, author, viewpoint</li>
        <li>Script- embeds client side to HTML doc</li>
        <li>http-equiv- sets HTTP header for content</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A Margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of the element</li>
          <li>A Padding indicates how much space we want INSIDE the element</li>
          <li>There are 3 way to use CSS STYLING: INLINE,INTERNAL, and EXTERNAL</li>
          <li>INLINE- styles elememts directly effevt in the html doc.</li>
          <li>-Quick permanent changes and could be applied to specific html tags</li>
          <li>-BUT it is LESS flexible then INTERNAL and EXTERNAL </li>
          <li>INTERNAL- contains CSS rule for the web page in the head section</li>
          <li>-The rules of internal would only effect the classes and ids of that page alone</li>
          <li>EXTERNAL- most prefered method b/c it allows devs to keep CSS rules in a seperate file</li>
          <li>-Using the * command in our style sheet we are Declaring that everthing on the page will have the style attchached to its command </li>

      <h2>Javascript-section</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A Variable- is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control Flow- is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Strings are always surrounded by quotation marks</li>
        <li>By inputing [consol.log] we are telling the computer to add an argument of what ever is inside of the parenthesis</li>
        <li>CHROME DEV TOOL- allows us to see if the code is running correctly and if our changes are being appplied</li>
        <li>Control Flow- is the order in which a computer executes code; Javascript runs from top to bottom so we must define certain topics before calling upon it or running the code or it will fail.</li>
        <li>[if] statement is a decision making procedure within our code that will execute only IF it meets desired conditions or True</li>
        <li>Also we can have multiple conditions within our [if] statement by using the [else if] keyword followed by our next condition</li>
        <li>Using the [===] is the strict equality operator that checks to see if two values are equal and returns the Booleon result [true] if value is/are equal and [false] if they arent equal.</li>
        <li>Array- is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data/values that are related in some way, allowing us to prefoema task on multiple peices of data all at once.</li>
        <li>***In JavaScript and many other programming languages, Arrays are ZERO INDEXED and SEQUENTIAL; meaning the first number or piece of data within the array order is [0] and always a whole number </li>
        <li>Index is also known as the location number; used for calling upon specific data within an array</li>
        <li>[for]loop is a pattern of indices to preform a task on an array allowing a single code Block to happen over and over gain</li>
        <li>*** We would need the arrays index values and length to tell the computer how many times it needs to repeat the pattern untile the entire array is logged through what action we set it to happen</li>
        <li>Function- is a set of instruction that tells the computer how to preform a task</li>
        <li>*** Todo so we would need to DEFINE the function and CALL the function.</li>
        <li>Ex. DEFINE FUNCTION- function [name-of-function]() {console.log add Block of code}</li>
        <li>Ex. CALL FUNCTION- [Name-of-function]()</li>
        <li>We will revisit this later in the Bootcamp, but the Math.floor() and Math.randome() both generate randome numbers or itemization of topics within our Array.</li>
